Installation
===========================================================

PySILLS is supported on Python version 3.11, but it can also be used with some previous versions of Python 3. It is
possible that previous versions can cause some problems, so that we recommend to use the newest version of Python 3.

It is planned that PySILLS will be able to install via PyPi and conda, since all required dependencies will then be
installed automatically.

Alternatively, it is possible to run PySILLS by a manual installation of Python and - if not already installed - the
following packages:

* numpy
* scipy
* pandas
* matplotlib

PySILLS can be used on all common computer operation systems that can run Python 3 and that support a GUI-based work
supported by keyboard and mouse usage.
