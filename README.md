# PySILLS

PySILLS is a newly developed, Python-based open source tool for a modern data 
reduction of LA-ICP-MS experiments. It is focused on the compositional analysis 
of major, minor and trace elements of minerals (and glasses) as well as of fluid
and melt inclusions.
PySILLS which was initially part of a M.Sc. thesis project, is developed by 
Maximilian Alexander Beeskow in the work group of Prof. Dr. Thomas Wagner and
Dr. Tobias Fusswinkel at RWTH Aachen University.
PySILLS was inspired conceptionally by the widely-used data reduction tool SILLS.
