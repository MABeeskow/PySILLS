PySILLS is a newly developed Python-based, open source tool for a modern data reduction of LA-ICP-MS experiments. It is
focused on the major, minor and trace element analysis of mineral compositions as well as of fluid and melt inclusion
compositions. PySILLS, which was initially part of a M.Sc. thesis project, is developed by Maximilian Alexander Beeskow
in the work group of Prof. Dr. Thomas Wagner and Dr. Tobias Fusswinkel at RWTH Aachen University. PySILLS was inspired
conceptionally by the widely-used data reduction tool SILLS.

Top Features
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
* works on all common computer systems that can run Python
* use of multiple standard reference materials in one project file
* use of multiple internal standards in one project file
* consideration of isotope-specific standard reference materials
* assemblage definition
* file-specific quick analysis
* intuitive, fast and flexible workflow
* multiple check-up possibilities
* export of processed LA-ICP-MS data (e.g. intensity ratios, analytical sensitivities, etc.) for external calculations
* many quality-of-life features

Planned Features
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
* more outlier detection algorithms
* replacement of scattered intensity values by regression curves
* extended language support
* in-built geothermometry analysis
* Jupyter notebooks for a browser-based data reduction of LA-ICP-MS experiments
* production of a video course on YouTube

Content
~~~~~~~
This documentation page contains information about the developer and authors of PySILLS, how it can be installed and,
most importantly, how it can be used based on tutorials and example projects.

Video Tutorials
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
It is planned to create a short educational video course on YouTube which will extend and support this documentation
page. The produced videos will be available on the `PySILLS YouTube channel <https://www.youtube.com/@PySILLS>`_.

Support
~~~~~~~
For general questions, the applications of PySILLS but also for feature suggestions, pleasse create an issue in the
`PySILLS <https://github.com/MABeeskow/PySILLS/issues>`_ repository. The developer of PySILLS, Maximilian Alexander
Beeskow, can also be reached on the `Software Underground Slack Workspace <https://swung.slack.com/home>`_.
